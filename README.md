## Setup

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository-name.git
cd your-repository-name

2. Install dependencies:

Make sure you have Node.js installed. Then, run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

npm install

3. Start the development server
After installing the dependencies, you can start the app in development mode:

npm start

The app should now be running at http://localhost:3000.

4.Mock API
For simulating server interactions, this app uses JSONPlaceholder API.

Fetch items: GET request to fetch a list of items.
Create item: POST request to add a new item.
Update item: PUT request to update an existing item.
Delete item: DELETE request to remove an item.
You can replace the mock API with a real API if needed, but JSONPlaceholder provides a useful mock API for development purposes.

5.Component Structure
The app consists of the following components:

ItemList: Displays a list of items fetched from the API, with the ability to add, delete, and update items.
ItemForm: A form to add a new item to the list.
ItemEditForm: A form to edit an existing item's title and description.

6.Functionality
The following features are implemented in this app:

1.Fetching items: When the app loads, it fetches the list of items from the mock API and displays them.
2.Adding items: Users can add a new item by filling out the form and submitting it.
3.Deleting items: Users can delete items by clicking the trash icon next to an item.
4.Editing items (Optional): Users can edit the title and description of an item.

7.Styling
The app is styled using Tailwind CSS. Tailwind provides utility-first classes that allow for fast and responsive styling without writing custom CSS.

The application is deployed on Vercel (or Netlify, depending on your preference). You can view the deployed application here:
